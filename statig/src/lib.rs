//!
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Concepts
//!
//! ### States
//!
//! States are defined by writing methods inside the `impl` block and adding
//! the `#[state]` attribute to them. By default the `event` argument will map
//!  to the event handled by the state machine.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use statig::prelude::*;
//! # #[derive(Default)]
//! # pub struct Blinky {
//! #     led: bool,
//! # }
//! #
//! # pub struct Event;
//! #
//! # #[state_machine(initial = "State::led_off()")]
//! # impl Blinky {
//! #
//! #[state]
//! fn led_on(event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//!     Transition(State::led_off())
//! }
//! #
//! #     #[state]
//! #     fn led_off(event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//! #         Transition(State::led_on())
//! #     }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Every state must return a `Response`. A `Response` can be one of three things:
//!
//! - `Handled`: The event has been handled.
//! - `Transition`: Transition to another state.
//! - `Super`: Defer the event to the next superstate.
//!
//! ### Superstates
//!
//! Superstates allow you to create a hierarchy of states. States can defer an event
//! to their superstate by returning the `Super` response.
//!
//! ```
//! # use statig::prelude::*;
//! # #[derive(Default)]
//! # pub struct Blinky {
//! #     led: bool,
//! # }
//! #
//! # pub enum Event {
//! #     TimerElapsed,
//! #     ButtonPressed
//! # }
//! #
//! # #[state_machine(initial = "State::led_off()")]
//! # impl Blinky {
//! #
//! #[state(superstate = "blinking")]
//! fn led_on(event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//!     match event {
//!         Event::TimerElapsed => Transition(State::led_off()),
//!         Event::ButtonPressed => Super
//!     }
//! }
//! #
//! #     #[state]
//! #     fn led_off(&mut self, event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//! #         self.led = true;
//! #         Transition(State::led_on())
//! #     }
//! #
//!
//! #[superstate]
//! fn blinking(event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//!     match event {
//!         Event::ButtonPressed => Transition(State::not_blinking()),
//!         _ => Handled
//!     }
//! }
//! #
//! #     #[state]
//! #     fn not_blinking(event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//! #         match event {
//! #             Event::ButtonPressed => Transition(State::led_on()),
//! #             _ => Super
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Superstates can themselves also have superstates.
//!
//! ### Actions
//!
//! Actions run when entering or leaving states during a transition.
//!
//! ```
//! # use statig::prelude::*;
//! # #[derive(Default)]
//! # pub struct Blinky {
//! #     led: bool,
//! # }
//! #
//! # pub enum Event {
//! #     TimerElapsed,
//! #     ButtonPressed
//! # }
//! #
//! # #[state_machine(initial = "State::led_off()")]
//! # impl Blinky {
//! #     #[state]
//! #     fn led_off(&mut self, event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//! #         self.led = true;
//! #         Transition(State::led_on())
//! #     }
//! #
//! #[state(entry_action = "enter_led_on", exit_action = "exit_led_on")]
//! fn led_on(event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//!     Transition(State::led_off())
//! }
//!
//! #[action]
//! fn enter_led_on() {
//!     println!("Entered LedOn");
//! }
//!
//! #[action]
//! fn exit_led_on() {
//!     println!("Exited LedOn");
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Context
//!
//! If the type on which your state machine is implemented has any fields, you
//! can access them inside all states, superstates or actions.
//!
//! ```
//! # use statig::prelude::*;
//! # #[derive(Default)]
//! # pub struct Blinky {
//! #     led: bool,
//! # }
//! #
//! # pub enum Event {
//! #     TimerElapsed
//! # }
//! #
//! # #[state_machine(initial = "State::led_off()")]
//! # impl Blinky {
//! #
//! #[state]
//! fn led_on(&mut self, event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//!     match event {
//!         Event::TimerElapsed => {
//!             self.led = false;
//!             Transition(State::led_off())
//!         }
//!         _ => Super
//!     }
//! }
//! #
//! #     #[state]
//! #     fn led_off(event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//! #         Transition(State::led_on())
//! #     }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Or alternatively, set `led` inside the entry action.
//!
//! ```
//! # use statig::prelude::*;
//! # #[derive(Default)]
//! # pub struct Blinky {
//! #     led: bool,
//! # }
//! #
//! # pub struct Event;
//! #
//! # #[state_machine(initial = "State::led_off()")]
//! # impl Blinky {
//! #     #[state]
//! #     fn led_on(&mut self, event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//! #         Transition(State::led_off())
//! #     }
//! #
//! #     #[state]
//! #     fn led_off(event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//! #         Transition(State::led_on())
//! #     }
//! #
//! #[action]
//! fn enter_led_off(&mut self) {
//!     self.led = false;
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ### State-local storage
//!
//! Sometimes you have data that only exists in a certain state. Instead of
//! adding this data to the context and potentially having to unwrap an
//! `Option<T>`, you can add it as an input to your state handler.
//!
//! ```
//! # use statig::prelude::*;
//! # #[derive(Default)]
//! # pub struct Blinky {
//! #     led: bool,
//! # }
//! #
//! # pub enum Event {
//! #     TimerElapsed,
//! #     ButtonPressed
//! # }
//! #
//! # #[state_machine(initial = "State::led_on(10)")]
//! # impl Blinky {
//! #
//! #[state]
//! fn led_on(counter: &mut u32, event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//!     match event {
//!         Event::TimerElapsed => {
//!             *counter -= 1;
//!             if *counter == 0 {
//!                 Transition(State::led_off())
//!             } else {
//!                 Handled
//!             }
//!         }
//!         Event::ButtonPressed => Transition(State::led_on(10))
//!     }
//! }
//! #
//! #     #[state]
//! #     fn led_off(event: &Event) -> Response<State> {
//! #         Transition(State::led_on(10))
//! #     }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! `counter` is only available in the `led_on` state but can also be accessed in
//! its superstates and actions.
//!
//! ## FAQ
//!
//! ### **What is this `#[state_machine]` proc-macro doing to my code? ðŸ¤¨**
//!
//! Short answer: nothing. `#[state_machine]` simply parses the underlying `impl`
//! block and derives some code based on its content and adds it to your source
//! file. Your code will still be there, unchanged. In fact `#[state_machine]`
//! could have been a derive macro, but at the moment Rust only allows derive macros
//! to be used on enums and structs. If you'd like to see what the generated code
//! looks like take a look at the test [with](./statig/tests/transition_macro.rs)
//! and [without](./statig/tests/transition.rs) macros.
//!
//! ### What advantage does this have over using the typestate pattern?
//!
//! I would say they serve a different purpose. The [typestate pattern](http://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/)
//! is very useful for designing an API as it is able to enforce the validity of
//! operations at compile time by making each state a unique type. But `statig`
//! is designed to model a dynamic system where events originate externally and
//! the order of operations is determined at run time. More concretely, this means
//! that the state machine is going to sit in a loop where events are read from
//! a queue and submitted to the state machine using the `handle()` method. If
//! we want to do the same with a state machine that uses the typestate pattern
//! we'd have to use an enum to wrap all our different states and match events
//! to operations on these states. This means extra boilerplate code for little
//! advantage as the order of operations is unknown so it can't be checked at
//! compile time. On the other hand `statig` gives you the ability to create a
//! hierarchy of states which I find to be invaluable as state machines grow in
//! complexity.
//!
//! ## Credits
//!
//! The idea for this library came from reading the book
//! [Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++](https://www.state-machine.com/doc/PSiCC2.pdf).
//! I highly recommend it if you want to learn how to use state machines to design
//! complex systems.
